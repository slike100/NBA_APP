# NBA_APP
Feel free to play around! Still a work in progress

## API
 - The bakend contains a custom microserviced API that is utilizing the NBA's public endpoints
 - Node and Express were utilized in the creation of the API
 
## Front-End
  - To show the usability and highlight the microserviced environment, I created two seperate front-ends.
  - Vue front-end
  - React front-end
  - Both are utlizing two different charting libraries to show player data (D3 and VueChart)
